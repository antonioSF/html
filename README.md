## Document & website structure
#### Structure your document properly:
* Use HTML5 semantic block level elements to define areas of your website

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>

		<!-- Character encoding for the document -->
		<meta charset="utf-8">

		<!-- Document Title -->
		<title>Eg. Today's feed | The Feeder</title>

		<!-- Document metadata / CSS external links / favicons -->

	</head>
	<body>

		<!-- Document main header used across all website pages -->
		<header>
			<!-- Eg. logo of website here -->

			<nav>
				<li><a href="#">about</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">services</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">contacts</a></li>
			</nav>
		</header>
		
		<!-- Page main content -->
		<main role="main">

			<!-- A section contains a thematic grouping of content with a heading -->
			<section>
				<!-- Main page Heading -->
				<h1>Eg. Your news feed aggregator page</h1>
			</section>
			
			<!-- Another example of a section -->
			<section>
				<!-- The section always contains a heading -->
				<h2>Eg. News Feed For today</h2>

				<!-- An article containing related individual standalone pieces of content  -->
				<article>
					<h2>Eg. 10 things you didn't knew about HTML</h2>
					<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
				</article>

				<!-- Another example of an article -->
				<article>
					<h2>Eg. 10 things you didn't knew about CSS</h2>
					<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
				</article>

			</section>

			<!-- The aside is complementary/related to the document's content 
			(it can be nested if directly related to the main content.
			If not, leave it outside the main content) -->
			<aside>
				<h2>Eg. Upcaming News</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Eg. News 1</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Eg. News 2</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">Eg. News 3</a></li>
				</ul>
			</aside>

		</main>

		<!-- Document main footer used across all website pages -->
		<footer>
			<p>&copy; Copyright 2018. All rights reversed.</p>
		</footer>

		<!-- JavaScript files -->
	</body>
</html>
```

#### DOCTYPE Declaration
In HTML, the Document Type Declaration is required at the beginning of a document. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called "quirks mode" when rendering a document.
The DOCTYPE originates from HTMLâ€™s SGML lineage and, in previous levels of HTML, was originally used to refer to a Document Type Definition (DTD). As HTML5 is no longer formally based upon SGML, the DOCTYPE no longer serves this purpose, and thus no longer needs to refer to a DTD. HTML5 defines three modes: quirks mode, limited quirks mode and no quirks mode. To ensure the most standards compliant rendering, it is important to ensure no-quirks mode is used.

```html
<!-- case insensitive -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- or -->
<!doctype html>
```
